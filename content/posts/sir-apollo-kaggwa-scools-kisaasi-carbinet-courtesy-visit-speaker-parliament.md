The Kisaasi Cabinet of Sir Apollo Kaggwa Schools recently had the privilege of paying a courtesy visit to the Speaker of Parliament. This visit provided our students with a unique opportunity to engage with one of the highest offices in the country, learn about the legislative process, and discuss matters of importance to our school community.

We extend our gratitude to the Speaker for welcoming us and fostering dialogue with our future leaders. Such experiences contribute to the holistic development of our students and instill in them a sense of civic responsibility.
