The Kisaasi Cabinet of Sir Apollo Kaggwa Schools recently undertook a remarkable educational journey as they paid a courtesy visit to the Speaker of Parliament. This prestigious engagement offered our young leaders a rare and enriching experience to interact with one of the highest legislative offices in the country. During the visit, the pupils were guided through the parliamentary chambers, introduced to the legislative process, and participated in thought-provoking discussions that broadened their understanding of national governance and leadership.



We are profoundly grateful to the Speaker of Parliament for the warm reception and for creating a platform where our learners could freely express their thoughts and inquiries. The Speaker’s willingness to engage with the pupils not only inspired confidence but also emphasized the importance of youth involvement in shaping the future of our nation. Through meaningful dialogue, the pupils were able to share perspectives on issues affecting the school community, reinforcing the value of active citizenship and open communication with public institutions.



Such opportunities are instrumental in nurturing well-rounded, civically conscious individuals. By connecting classroom learning to real-world leadership structures, the visit strengthened the pupils’ appreciation for democracy, public service, and responsibility. It is through these transformative experiences that Sir Apollo Kaggwa Schools continues to build a generation of informed, empowered, and visionary leaders ready to contribute positively to society.
