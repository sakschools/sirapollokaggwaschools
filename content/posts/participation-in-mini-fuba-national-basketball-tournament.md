Sir Apollo Kaggwa Schools recently participated in the prestigious FUBA Mini National Basketball Tournament held in Kampala, an event that brought together schools from across the country to compete at a high level. Our boys and girls teams took to the courts with remarkable energy, discipline, and confidence, showcasing the true spirit of competitive basketball. Their participation not only demonstrated their talent but also underscored the schoolâ€™s growing influence in national sports events.



The success and composure displayed by our pupils throughout the tournament are a testament to the strength of our talent development program, which plays a central role in nurturing athletic ability and character in our learners. With unwavering support from our dedicated coaching staff, the pupils were able to apply refined techniques, strategic plays, and teamwork that have been consistently instilled through rigorous training sessions. Their display of sportsmanship and unity was nothing short of inspiring.



We applaud our pupils for their exceptional performance and thank our coaches and the entire talent development program team for their tireless efforts in grooming young sportsmen and women. This milestone is yet another sign that Sir Apollo Kaggwa Schools are committed to holistic education. 

Stay tuned for more thrilling updates as we continue to excel in sports and beyond!
